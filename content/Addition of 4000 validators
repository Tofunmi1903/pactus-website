## 4000 Validators reached

We have achieved a significant milestone, surpassing 4,000 validators, which enhances our blockchain security and decentralization.​ This increase in validators strengthens our network and reflects our community's growing engagement in maintaining the blockchain's integrity.

### Role and Incentives of Pactus Validators

Validators are crucial in processing transactions, creating blocks, and ensuring our network integrity. By self-electing through a randomization algorithm, we enhance fairness in the selection process. Each validator stakes PAC coins, increasing the network's security and incentivizing honest behavior and engagement.

At Pactus, we reward our validators for their contributions, providing PAC coin rewards for successfully proposed and accepted blocks. This reward structure encourages ongoing participation, enhancing our network's stability and resilience.

### Summary of Future Participation

Our achievement of over 4,000 validators signifies a thriving ecosystem within our ecosystem, creating the way for a more secure and decentralized digital landscape. This accomplishment isn’t the last; our validators have surpassed 4000. You should also join the moving train and together we can bring Pacrus to the forefront.
